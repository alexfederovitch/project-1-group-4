## Proposal

Search for images and videos based on a destination.

1. User enters a geographical search criteria.
1. Using Pixabay API we get images relative to the search criteria.
1. Using YouTube API we get "travel guide" videos relative to the search criteria.
1. Using Google Maps API, display the search value on a map.
1. Use Video.js as an embedded video player to play the videos from YouTube.
